This is still a work in progress, your mileage may vary.

To test run:
```bash
terraform plan
```

To create the VPCs run:
```bash
terraform apply
```

A VPC to VPC VPN in AWS is named a peering, and a network trace is called Flow Logging.
With more time I would create some instances with Ansible to demonstrate this.
