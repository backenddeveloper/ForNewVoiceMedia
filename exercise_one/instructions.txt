Please write a program, which will meet the following requirement.

Accept the input of 6 consecutive numbers from command line arguments (each number is one argument). Let’s call it original input.

Secondly, the script must present to the user through standard output the following simple choice menu and operate accordingly in the background with the numbers the user entered previously:

1) Perform subtraction and show output on screen comma separated.

2) Perform multiplication and store result in a JSON file (i.e. {“InputNumber1”: x, “InputNumber2”: y, “InputNumber3”: a, “InputNumber4”: b, “InputNumber5”: c, “InputNumber6”: d, “Multiplication”: X }, where x, y, a, b, c and d are user line arguments and X is the multiplication result)

3) Pick randomly a number and show it on screen.

4) Print sorted (highest to lowest) array/list numbers.

5) Print sorted (lowest to highest) array/list numbers

Keep in mind that the script must respond appropriately upon possible human-errors. Also, the above choice menu must run forever on a loop until the user kills the program through SIGNIT or CTRL+C

Optionally (as a stretch goal) the script can store the data to Sqlite DB. Desirable tables are: Datetime, Input and subtraction outcome
